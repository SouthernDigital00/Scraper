# RISE Inventory Scraper Project

This project automates the monitoring of MAP pricing and inventory levels for Rise Armament products listed on reseller websites (starting with ar15discounts.com).

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… **Excel Integration**: Reads product SKUs and URLs from an Excel file and updates MAP price + inventory status.
- âœ… **Playwright Automation**: Uses browser automation to select product variants and extract cart-level inventory info.
- âœ… **Email Alerts**: Sends notifications when products go out of stock using Gmail SMTP.
- âœ… **.BAT + Task Scheduler**: Runs automatically on a schedule via a local `.bat` script.
- âœ… **Multi-site Ready**: Built to support scraping from more than one retail domain.
